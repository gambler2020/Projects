In fact, I have been to quite a few KFC outlets in Kolkata and elsewhere (including abroad). I have come to this one many times.

The people at the counter were inattentive (I know the policy of appointing people who are differently abled and I appreciate that, this was not someone with hearing issues or something akin) and not only to me. The food was served cold. They were very miserly with the fries, but since that was ice cold I did not really mind. I had specifically asked for no ice in my drinks, but the usual amount was there. There was a handwash section which was incredibly dirty. It was a bad experience. I don't think I will go back to this outlet.",-1,negative

It seems every time I go there they get my order wrong as there's always something missing and it's very frustrating when you get home as your not going to go out again to complain. I can't understand what's hard about reading your order from a screen and putting it in a bag. I tried to ring them back to complain but nobody answers and then you get the dreaded answer machine. I left a message of complaint and my phone number and they couldn't even be bothered to ring me back. I went through the drive through the other week and then when I got to the display they told that the drive through was closed as not enough staff. I asked them why they didn't put a cone at the entrance of the driver through as there was one at the side to stop people from driving through only to be told they were too busy to put one there.  I made my order, departed just as a KFC delivery truck was just arriving. Dont know what happened but they suddenly found staff to unload the truck but couldn't find one to put a cone there because they were too busy. It's got to be the worst KFC in Manchester and I've given them one star which is just about right. It's the last time I will be visiting them after 21 years of giving them my money.

23,Sarah Lockwood,1.0,Disgusting service at KFC and thereafter!!!!,"I drove through the drive through last night to pick up some food with my boyfriend and his two children, 10 and 9 years old. There was a car in front of us getting served, when we got to the speaker my boyfriend ordered some food, we were told there was no beans and smash. My boyfriend was a little drunk and made a joke about the lady in front ordering it all, our order was placed and we drove to the next window.When we got to the pay window my boyfriend made a silly joke about the lady in the car in front eating all the food, however the two girls serving started shouting at him saying the UK average size was now a size 16, he tried to play it down, however I laughed with the girls for sharing their opinion. It got very heated and one of the girls said I feel sorry for your girlfriend, at which point I could see it was going too far and shouted enough. The girls then slammed the serving window shut, we waited for our food. Our food was taken to the back of the shop so we could not see it being put together, the window finally opened and the bag was thrown at me as I was driving. We were then ignored even though I beeped my horn because we had not been given our drink, eventually a different girl with red hair came to the window and aggressively gave me our bottle of pop. We arrived home with our order and noticed that gravy had leaked all over the car, my boyfriend trainers, my handbag, we took the bag into the house which leaked all over the drive and onto the carpet in our hallway, we took the food into the kitchen which covered the floor and opened the bag. We had ordered two gravies and due to having no large tubs we were given 4, every single one had no lid on. Whilst I can accept one lid may of fallen off, I find it hard to believe that all four had come off and suspect that this was done on purpose by the two girls. I would also like to add that while requesting my pop I asked the girl with red hair to speak to manager, she told me she was the Manager and slammed to window.I rang the shop and requested to talk to the manager which in fact was a gentlemen called Dominic and not the girl who told me she was the Manager.Dom was very polite on the phone and offered to redo my order and give 25% off my next order, he also said he would be dealing with the girls.I then asked who would be cleaning my car, drive, handbag, trainers and kitchen, obviously he was not in a position to offer anything.I said goodbye but I was not happy so I returned to the shop, I took pictures of both girls for my complaint and asked to speak to Dom. He came out and again was very apologetic, the two girls were there, one kept saying I swear on my life I did not take the lids off, I kept asking Dom what was going to be done with my house, belongings etc.One of the girls started getting very abusive and at one point threatened violence, Dom asked her to go in the back, the other girl continued, she was also asked to leave by Dom. Again Dom could not of apologised more, however this does not resolve the issue, I would like to know what KFC can do to resolve this matter, reference my bag, trainers, car, drive, carpet and kitchen.I have also contacted the KFC Care Squad with no joy what so ever!!!!!!!I have cleaned everything now, however my car still has gravy everywhere!!! Apparently the senior management team at KFC are refusing to meet the cost, I have asked for this to be escalated, but as yet no reply. I also asked for a copy of their refusal, I was told this could not be shared.Not only is this disappointing food wise but it's also disgusting how Customers are treated, I have never been threatened with violence in any takeaway shop before. I have given KFC every opportunity to resolve this matter but as yet they are refusing to do anything, other than a £25 voucher.

40,Lorraine mcelhatton,1.0,Our order was late and the food was…,"Our order was late and the food was cold. The chicken pieces were small and the overall value for money was appalling frankly. This is my second negative review in as many weeks and to be honest I'm not sure what I'm providing feedback for as unlike other businesses you don't get any acknowledgement. This will be our last order anyway. The food is mediocre, service poor, and value rubbish. I will find an alternative takeaway to spend my money on.",-1,negative,Debopam,4.0,Good as always,"Does KFC needs a separate review, when it meets the standard at all times at all locations, well almost.We had a satisfactory visit here, and the drizzle outside made the experience better. Hop in if you are at City Centre",1,positive

When trying to contact to speak to them to answer I either get hung up on or just not answered. Will never be ordering from here again, I’m honestly disgusted for how much I have paid for half an order.",-1,negative,Amrit26,5.0,My favorite place of visit...,"This is a place I can go day-in and day-out. The KFC if you have not tried yet, then its hardly anything that you have tried in your life. A must-must recommended place. Try any chicken item, I am sure it would be an experience. ",1,positive
